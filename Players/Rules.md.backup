## Sicherman Plus One

This is a thought experiment to create a small game based on Microlite20 that uses unusual dice. This is a work in progress.

### Dice

This game uses three dice, two sicherman d12s and a regular d12. For ease of reference, the dice are named Big, Low, and Standard. The Big Die is numbered 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,15,16. The Low Die is numbered 1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,8. The Standard Die is numbered from 1 to 12 per a standard die.

#### Required Rolls

On a required roll, the rules will state which di(c)e are required. B12 is rolling a Big Die. SL12 is rolling a Standard Die and a Low Die together and summing the results of each die. There are only seven possible required rolls. L12, S12, B12, SL12, BL12, BS12, and BSL12.

If a required roll has advantage, an extra die is rolled and the die with the lowest result is removed. For a required roll with disadvantage, an extra die is rolled and the die with the highest result is removed.

The die added is the biggest one that is not a part of the required roll. If an S12 is the required roll, a B12 is added to the roll. If the required roll is a BL12, the S12 is added. If the required roll is BSL12, make two required rolls and use the highest result for advantage or the lowest result for disadvantage.

### Stats
There are 3 stats : Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX) and Mind (MIND).

#### Determining Stats
Roll BS12, BL12, and SL12. Allocate each result to an individual stat.

Stat bonus = (STAT-12)/2, round down.

### Ancestries

Those of Dwarven ancestry gain Darkvision. You can see in dim light as if it were bright light. You can see in darkness as if it was dim light. You cannot discern colors in darkness. You also gain 1 additional HP per level.

Those of Elven ancestry can cast a 0 Level Mage spell once a day, regardless of class. This spell cannot cause damage.

Those of Halfling ancestry may reroll any required rolls with the lowest possible result. They must take the result of the second roll.

Those of Human ancestry can adapt to any climate. They roll with advantage to resist damage from extreme hot or cold. They also take 1 point less damage from heat or cold attacks.

### Cultures

Those that grew up in a predominatly human culture receive +1 to all skill rolls

Those from Elven Cultures receive a +2 MIND bonus

Those that hail from a Dwarven Culture get a +2 STR bonus

Friends from Halfling Cultures get +2 DEX bonus

### Classes
The classes are Fighter, Rogue, Mage, Cleric. Characters begin at Level 1.

Fighters wear any kind of armor and use shields. They have a +3 bonus to Physical and add +1 to all attack and damage rolls. This increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels on.

Rogues can use light armor. They have a +3 bonus to Subterfuge. If they successfully Sneak (usually sub+DEX, but depends on situation) up on a foe they can add their Subterfuge skill rank to the damage of their first attack.

Magi wear no armor. They can cast arcane spells, and gain a +3 bonus to Knowledge.

Clerics can wear light or medium armor. They cast divine spells and gain +3 bonus to Communication. A Cleric can Turn Undead with a successful Magic Attack. DC is the current Hit Points of the Undead. If the DC is exceeded by 12 it is destroyed. This can be used (2 + Level + MIND Bonus) times per day.

### Skills
There are just 4 skills : Physical, Subterfuge, Knowledge and Communication. Roll higher than the given Difficulty Class to succeed.

Skill rank = your level + any bonus due to your ancestry, class or culture.
Skill roll = required roll + skill rank + whatever stat bonus is most applicable to the use + situation modifiers

For example, Climbing would use Physical + STR bonus. Dodging a falling rock is Physical + DEX bonus. Finding a trap is Subterfuge + MIND bonus. Disabling a trap is Subterfuge + DEX bonus.

### Avoiding Trouble

To avoid trouble in this game is usually a skill roll that depends on the type of trouble. Use Physical + STR for tests of Fortitude and Physical + DEX for a test of reflexes. Avoiding trouble from magic is a required roll modified by your MIND bonus + your level.

### Magic

Magi can cast any arcane spell, and Clerics any divine spell, with a spell level equal or below 1/2 their class level, rounded up. They have access to all arcane spells in the SRD spell list.

Casting a spell of any kind costs Hit Points. The cost is 1 + double the level of the spell being cast:

| Spell Level | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 
| HP Cost | 1 | 3 |	5 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 13 | 15 | 17 | 19 |

This loss cannot be healed normally but is recovered after 8 hours rest. There is no need to memorize spells in advance.

Just because a character can cast any spell, doesn't mean that they should.

Choose spells that suit the character. Select one "signature" spell per spell level from 1st upward that they prefer to use over any other. These spells are easier to cast due to familiarity, costing 1 less HP to use.

The Difficulty Class (DC) for all spells is: 12 + Caster Level + Caster's MIND bonus

### Combat

Hit Points for most characters star with STR Stat + S12. Fighters determine HP with STR Stat + B12. If HP reach 0, unconscious and near death. Further damage directly reduces STR. If that reaches 0, death.

Most characters roll S12 + DEX bonus for initiative order. Rogues roll B12 + DEX. Characters act in order, counting down from highest result to lowest. A character can do one thing each turn; move, attack, cast a spell, etc.

Melee attack bonus = STR bonus + Level
Missile attack bonus = DEX bonus + Level
Magic attack bonus = MIND bonus + Level

Add attack bonus to d20 roll. If higher than your opponent's Armor Class (AC), it's a hit. A result of 24 or greater is automatically a critical doing maximum damage.

Fighters and Rogues can use DEX bonus + Level as Melee attack bonus instead if wielding a light weapon. Fighters and Rogues can wield 2 light weapons and attack with both in a round if they take a -2 penalty on all attack rolls that round. Rapiers count as light weapons, but you cannot wield two rapiers at the same time.

If the total bonus is +6 or more a second attack can be made with a -5 penalty. If the total bonus is +11 or more a third attack can be made at -10. For example, if the total bonus is +12, three attacks can be made at +12/+7/+2.

Add STR bonus to Melee damage, x2 for 2-handed weapons.

Armor Class (AC) = 10 + DEX bonus + Armor bonus.

### Other Hazards
* Falling: 1d6 damage per 10', half damage on Phys + DEX save. DC=depth fallen in feet
* Spikes: add +1 point to falling damage per 10' fallen, max +10
* Poison: Phys + STR save to avoid or for half, depending on poison. Effect varies with poison type.
* Extreme Heat & Cold: If not wearing suitable protection, Phys + STR save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking S12 damage on each failed save.

### Level Advancement
Encounter Level = Hit Dice of defeated monsters, or the given EL for the trap, situation, etc. Add +1 for each doubling of the number of foes. eg: 1 kobold = EL1. 2 kobolds = EL2. 4 kobolds = EL3, etc.

Add up the Encounter Levels (ELs) of every encounter you take part in. When the total = 10 x your current level, you've advanced to the next level. Reset the total to 0 after advancing.

Each level adds one of the following (player's choice):
+1 to all attack rolls
+1 to all skills

Every even level adds:
+S12 to Hit Points (+B12 for Fighters)

If the level divides by three (i.e. level 3,6,9,etc.) add 1 point to STR, DEX or MIND.
Fighters gain +1 to their attack and damage rolls at levels 5,10,15,etc.
Clerics and Magi gain access to new spell levels at levels 3,5,7,9,etc.

Example: The 1st level adventurers have just completed a dungeon adventure, and defeated 5 EL1 encounters, an EL2 trap and the EL3 leader. That's a total of EL10, so they all advance to level 2. They need to defeat another 20 Encounter Levels to reach Level 3.
