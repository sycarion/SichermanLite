## Sicherman Plus One

This is a thought experiment to create a small game based on the 5e SRD that uses unusual dice. The fist dradt of rules is in the z_d20 folder of this repo. This is a work in progress.

### Required Di(c)e

This game uses two sicherman 12-sided dice, a regular 12-sided die, and regular 6-sided dice. For ease of reference, the 12-sided dice are named Big, Low, and Standard. 

The Big Die (B12) is numbered 1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,15,16. 

The Low Die (L12) is numbered 1,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,8.

The Standard Die (S12) is numbered from 1 to 12 per a standard die.

The 6-sided dice are abbreviated as D6.

## Ability Scores

Four abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical and mental characteristics:

**Strength**, measuring physical power and endurance
**Dexterity**, measuring agility
**Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
**Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores.

The basic rule behind these rolls: roll required di(c)e, add an ability modifier derived from one of the four ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

### Required Di(c)e

Required di(c)e will be provided in the rules or by the ajudicator. They will be written in abbreviated form such as L12 for the Low 12-sided die, BS12 for rolling the Big and Standard 12-sided dice and adding the results together, or 3D6 for rolling three 6-sided dice and summing the results.

A combination of 12 and 6-side dice will be written with the 12-sided di(c)e first plus the 6-sided di(c)e.

For example, L12+D6 is rolling the Low 12-sided die and a 6-sided die and summing the results.

There are only seven possible required 12-sided di(c)e: L12, S12, B12, SL12, BL12, BS12, and BSL12.

No more than six 6-sided die will ever be rolled.

If no di(c)e are stated for a required roll, use S12.

#### Adavnatage and Disadvantage

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you will use an extra die to determine the results. Advantage means to discard the lowest result from any dice rolled, Disadvantage means to discard the highest result.

The extra is determined by adding the next largest 12-sided die available. For example, if rolling L12, the S12 is added. If rolling BS12, the L12 is added. If the required di(c)e are only 6-sided di(c)e, the extra die is L12.

Advantage or Disadvantage on a BSL12 roll is determined by rolling twice and taking the highest result for advantage or the lowest result for disadvantage.
